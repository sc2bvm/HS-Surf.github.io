HS-Surf: A Novel High-Frequency Surface Shell Radiance Field to Improve Large-Scale Scene Rendering

We have presented the comparisons between HS-Surf with other models on Transamerica, Building, and Residence.

The scenes of demo1 and demo2 are Transamerica and Residence, and the compared model is the best ZipNeRF.

The scene of demo3 is Building, and the compared model is the best GridNeRF.

The other demos display the rendering results of HS-Surf on these scenes.
